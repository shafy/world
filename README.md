# World Bug Report

The world is a simulation. File bugs here.

## What is this?

If you can read this, per definition, the world simulation is running. Unfortunately, we've lost the source code. This is an attempt to rebuild the world simulation code as open source software, and at the same time keep track of bugs that you see happening in your daily interactions with the world.


## Why rebuild?

The simulation has been running for a long, long time (some estimates put it at 13.8 billion years). Of course, no one knows who wrote the original code. All we know is that they had a big fat party aptly called The Big Bang when they launched this thing.

However, lately, we've been racking up some bugs and issues. For starters, there's this fundamental bug called [Climate Change](https://github.com/shafy/world/issues/1) that has been getting worse over the last few decades. Most recently, some jabronis infected our code with a virus named Covid-19 that rendered the simulation unusable for a lot of people.

To fix these issues, we need to rebuild the source code. Only then can we roll back some of the changes and continue with a different branch of the simulation.


## Contributing

The best way to contribute is to submit and discuss bugs that you encounter. If you want to help to rebuild the software that runs the world, feel free to pick an issue or a feature (from list below) and submit a pull request.
